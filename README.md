# PixelCraft AI ‡ÆÜ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ü üé®

PixelCraft AI is a Flutter application that generates unique pixel art images based on user prompts using Google's Imagen model via the Gemini API. Users can enter a text prompt, generate an image, view it within the app, and save it to their device's photo library.

## Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation**: Leverages Google's Imagen model to create pixel art from text prompts.
*   **Simple UI**: Clean and intuitive interface for easy interaction.
*   **Image Display**: Shows the generated pixel art directly in the app.
*   **Save to Photos**: Allows users to save their creations to their device's photo gallery (iOS/Android).
*   **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flutter for Web, iOS, and Android support.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1.  **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed. You can find installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2.  **Git**: Required for cloning the repository.
3.  **IDE**: An IDE like VS Code with the Flutter extension or Android Studio.
4.  **(For iOS)**: Xcode installed on a macOS machine.
5.  **(For Android)**: Android Studio and Android SDK setup.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luka-loehr/pixelcraft-ai.git
cd pixelcraft-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command will fetch all the necessary Dart/Flutter packages defined in `pubspec.yaml`.

### 3. Set Up API Key

The application requires a Google Generative AI API key to interact with the Imagen model.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory (e.g., `/pixelcraft-ai/.env`).
2.  Add your API key to this file in the following format:

    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.
    **Note**: The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should not be committed to version control.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application on various platforms.

### Web

1.  Ensure web support is enabled in your Flutter environment:
    ```bash
    flutter config --enable-web
    ```
2.  Run the application in Chrome (or another supported browser):
    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    ```

### iOS

1.  **Simulator**:
    *   Open the iOS Simulator (e.g., via Xcode or `open -a Simulator`).
    *   Find your simulator's ID by running: `flutter devices`
    *   Run the app: `flutter run -d YOUR_SIMULATOR_ID` (replace `YOUR_SIMULATOR_ID`)
2.  **Physical Device**:
    *   Connect your iOS device via USB.
    *   You may need to set up code signing in Xcode:
        1.  Open the iOS project in Xcode: `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
        2.  Select the `Runner` project in the navigator.
        3.  Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
        4.  Select your team and ensure a valid signing certificate is chosen.
    *   Run the app: `flutter run` (Flutter should auto-detect your connected device).

### Android

1.  **Emulator**:
    *   Launch an Android emulator via Android Studio (AVD Manager) or the command line.
    *   Find your emulator's ID: `flutter devices`
    *   Run the app: `flutter run -d YOUR_EMULATOR_ID` (replace `YOUR_EMULATOR_ID`)
2.  **Physical Device**:
    *   Connect your Android device via USB (ensure Developer Options and USB Debugging are enabled on the device).
    *   Run the app: `flutter run` (Flutter should auto-detect your connected device).

### Desktop (Experimental)

While not explicitly configured in this iteration, Flutter supports desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). You can enable them via:
```bash
flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop # e.g., --enable-macos-desktop
flutter create . # To generate platform-specific files if not present
flutter run -d <platform> # e.g., -d macos
```
Further configuration might be needed.
